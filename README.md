Hello, I'm science-bicyle! 👋🚴‍♂️
Welcome to my page! Here, I share what I've learned along the way in various fields. My goal is to compile my knowledge and projects in one place, creating a useful resource for both myself and the community.

My Interests:
🤖 Artificial Intelligence (AI): Projects and research in machine learning and deep learning.
📐 Mathematics: Working on mathematical problems and algorithms.
🔐 Cryptography: Encryption algorithms and security protocols.
🗃️ Databases: Exploring SQL and NoSQL database systems.
💻 Hardware: Software development for hardware and embedded systems.
🛠️ Low-Level Programming: System programming and efficient memory management.
🐍 Python: Projects in data science, AI, and general software development.
💼 .NET: Developing software using C# and the .NET platform.
Feel free to explore my projects, check out the code, or contribute if something piques your interest! I'm always eager to learn new things and share them with others.
